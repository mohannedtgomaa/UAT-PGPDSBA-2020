lm(Sales~Price)
#Show a -ve relation betwen price and sales, as price increase by 1 unit, sales drop by 53USD (Note: sales are 1kUSD).
```    


```{r}
summary(lm(Sales~Price))
#At the moment price seems like a significant predictor of sales, as proven by its P value. But, our model as is, only predicts ~20% of the variance in sales, as shown in our R2.
```

#Before adding further values letâ€™s check for multicollinearity
```{r}
install.packages("rms")
library(rms)
Trail.MLM= lm(Sales~.,data = Carseats)
vif(Trail.MLM) #No signs of multicollinearity.
```

```{r}
summary(Trail.MLM)
#Remove all of the follwoing,as they proved not to be a significant predictor of sales; Population, Education , UrbanYes and USYes. 
```

```{r}
